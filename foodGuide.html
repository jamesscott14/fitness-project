    <h2>Protein</h2>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4" style="padding-top: 20px;">
    <p class="info">The first <span class="emphasize">MACRO</span>nutrient. It's really the <span class="handyMan">HANDYMAN</span> of the macros. When we think of protein, we think of it as the  BUILDER and REPAIRMAN of our bodies. It's responsible for building and repairing things such as red blood cells, skin, hair, muscles, etc;</p>

    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
      <p class="info">This <span class="emphasize">MACRO</span> is vital in order for our body to grow, and to aid in its maintenance.  It's found in all cells of the body and the most important component in building our body's structure.</p>
      <h3>How does protein build muscle?</h3>
      <p class="info">
        After a weight-lifting  workout, the body needs to repair muscle cells and in order to grow, it needs to build new muscle. This is where protein comes in. Protein is made up of amino-acids which the body uses to build muscle. So when a person eats protein, their body breaks the protein down into amino-acids which in turn travel throughout the body and build new muscle cells.</p>


            <!-- <p>Protein is for building things in your body. Consider it the handy-man of the three <span class="emphasize">MACROS</span>. Protein BUILDS and REPAIRS blood cells, skin tissue, muscles, nails, and hair just to name a few. -->

<!-- CARB ROW -->
<div class="row">

  <div class="col-md-12 underline">
    <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="col-md-4">
      <p class="info">Carbohyrates make up the second <span class="emphasize">MACRO</span>. It's the <span class="emphasize">ENERGIZER</span>. Your body digests it very quickly AND it comes in all shapes and forms making it the most available of the MACROS.</p>
      <h3>What do carbs do?</h3>
      <p class="info">Carbs generally have several major functions in the body. They provide the body energy, break down fatty acids, prevent ketosis, and contain fibre.</p>
      <h3>Complex vs Simple Carbs</h3>
      <p class="info">To understand the various types of carbs and how they affect the body, it is very important to remember that ALL CARBS ARE SUGAR. </p>
      <p class="info">When the a person ingests carbohydrates, the body breaks them down into GLUCOSE which is the primary component for energy. When a person eats too much, the body SAVES the excess glucose into BODY FAT. </p>
      <p class="info">Simple carbs are foods that have been modified and stripped of most nutrients and so digest quicker than simple carbs; they are one of the central causes of obesity. On the other hand, Complex Carbs are usually natural and whole foods that take longer to digest; they are the most nutrient-dense foods and absolutely essential to ANY diet plan. How quickly carbs are digested is a significant component of how the body reacts. When digestion is slow, the body is able to use energy efficiently when it needs it. In contrast, when digestion is fast, the body is shocked with an excessive amount of energy and as a result, uses what it needs and saves the rest.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">

    <h3>When is it a good time to eat Simple Carbs?</h3>
      <p class="info">Simple Carbs provide the body with an explosion of energy. If the timing of when it's ingested is either too early or too late, the body will have excess energy that it doesn't need at the moment and store it as fat to be used later. The right time to eat complex carbs is when your body is in need of quick energy an example being right after a workout.</p>

    <h3>Sources of Simple Carbs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>White Bread</li>
      <li>White Rice</li>
      <li>Pastas</li>
      <li>White Potatoe</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When is it a good time to eat Complex Carbs?</h3>
    <p class="info">Complex Carbs are natural, whole food options, very low in calories and break down slowly in the body, making them a great addition to any meal and at any time of the day. These foods are great to eat before a workout.</p>


  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>Carb Food Sources:</h3>


        <ul>
          <li>Vegetables</li>
              <p class="info">It's important to know that vegetables in particular are the most nutritious foods of all. They are closely associated with decreased chance of heart disease, cancer, and a plethora of other disease, illness, and injury.</p>
          <li>Fruits</li>
              <p class="info">Fruits offer many nutritional benefits, they can be rich in essential vitamins and minerals to the body. However, one downside to fruit is that is full of sugar. Therefore, don't eat fruit too often but include it in your daily life.</p>
          <li>Whole Grains</li>
            <p class="info">There's a lot of debate around the subject of "whole grains". Are they good or bad? The truth is, the term "whole grains" is something that was coined by the major food companies to define a wide range of foods. Brown bread, brown rice, "multi-grain bagels", etc. Some studies suggest that "whole grains" are actually much worse that "white grains". The reason being, when something like white bread or a white bagel is manufactured, the original grain is stripped of its nutrients, but whole grains go one step farther. Once grains have been stripped and turned white, food companies add a "special blend" of nutrients back into the white bread. What this means is that "whole grains" are more processed and worse for your health. </p>
        </ul>

<!-- FAT ROW -->
  <div class='row'>
    <div class="col-md-12 underline">
      <h2>Fats</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p class="info">Fat is the most powerful <span class="emphasize">MACRO</span> of them all at 9 calories a gram. Fat is the most misunderstood of the macros. We often see foods at the grocery store labelled as having '0% fat' and this leads to the common misconception that eating fat leads to being fat. The truth is that fat is essential for the body to survive.</p>

      <h3>What does Fat do in the body?</h3>
      <p class='info'>Fat has many benefits. It's essential for normal growth and dvelopment, energy, absorbing vitamins, cushioning for the orgrans, cell membrance maintenance, and making food taste better!</p>
      <h3>Saturated or Un-Saturated?</h3>
      <p class="info">The truth is that both types of fat are essential for the body since they have a different list of benefits. Saturated fat is usually solid at room temperature and can be found naturally in animal meat, plant oils, or dairy products such as cheese or milk. Un-Saturated fat is typically liquid and is found in foods such as nuts, seeds, fish, avocados, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>BAD Fats</h3>
      <p class="info">The bad fat we find in the food kingdom comes from processed oils like canola oil, vegetable oil, and corn oil which, without much surprise is widely used in packaged junk foods as well at most fast food restaurants. Processed fats are bad for the body and provide absolutely no nutrients or benefits.</p>
      <h3>Foods that make you FAT</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chips</li>
        <li>Chicken Wings</li>
        <li>Fries</li>
        <li>Fast Food Burgers</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>Deadly Duo: Sugar + Fat</h3>
      <p class=info>The worst kinds of food that a person can eat is pretty much anything that is processed and comes in a package. Did you ever stop to think WHY processed foods are bad for your health? First, they're packed with chemical ingredients. One that is on almost every ingredients label is 'xanthan gum'. It's used as a 'food thickening agent'. Xanthan gum is also found in cosmetic products! This is only ONE example of many.<br>

      Secondly, these foods are a formed using heavy amounts of processed sugar and fat in sync making them the MOST fattening foods available for human consumption. Besides the insane calorie count of these foods, they also cause people to feel cravings to keep coming back and eating more! There's not much of a difference between how illegal 'upper' drugs like cocaine and junk food like a chocolate bar interact with the chemistry of our brains. These foods are highly addictive and mainly responsbile for the obesity epidemic across the world.
